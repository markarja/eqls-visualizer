	The <b>European Quality of Life (EQLS)</b> survey is a unique, pan-European survey that examines 
	both the objective circumstances of European citizens' lives and how they feel about those 
	circumstances and their lives in general. It looks at a range of issues, such as employment, 
	income, education, housing, family, health and work-life balance. It also looks at subjective 
	topics, such as people's levels of happiness, how satisfied they are with their lives, and how 
	they perceive the quality of their societies.
